However, the majority of efforts are concentrated on environmental and technical dimensions. So, what about social sustainability? At a time when the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive mandates businesses to report not just financial information but also sustainability data, comprehending the impacts of software on sustainability and its role in achieving greater sustainability has become exceedingly urgent and essential. Presently, research concerning social sustainability remains limited, and offering a comprehensive perspective on sustainability or a method of assessment for software practitioners or users remains a distant dream.Therefore, as a researcher with a background in environmental sustainability, I am interested in exploring the social dimension of sustainability, bridging the gap with the environmental dimension, and simultaneously evaluating the interplay between the two. Following a very brief introduction of my research background in sustainability, I will delve into the (lack of common) definition of social sustainability, provide a quick overview of the existing literature in this field, and propose potential directions for further investigation. My goal is to stimulate discussions on this subject and to receive insights regarding such a developing field.","tags":["Sustainability","Social","SE"],"title":"Sustainable Software Engineering: What about Social Sustainability?","type":"event"},{"authors":["Tim Yarally","Luís Cruz","Daniel Feitosa","June Sallou","Arie van Deursen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692866190,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692866190,"objectID":"5b23e68516b0a76e5a2cd68baa78b0af","permalink":"https://jnsll.github.io/publication/batchinggreenai/","publishdate":"2023-08-24T10:36:30+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/batchinggreenai/","section":"publication","summary":"The batch size is an essential parameter to tune during the development of new neural networks. Amongst other quality indicators, it has a large degree of influence on the model's accuracy, generalisability, training times and parallelisability. This fact is generally known and commonly studied. However, during the application phase of a deep learning model, when the model is utilised by an end-user for inference, we find that there is a disregard for the potential benefits of introducing a batch size. In this study, we examine the effect of input batching on the energy consumption and response times of five fully-trained neural networks for computer vision that were considered state-of-the-art at the time of their publication. The results suggest that batching has a significant effect on both of these metrics. Furthermore, we present a timeline of the energy efficiency and accuracy of neural networks over the past decade. We find that in general, energy consumption rises at a much steeper pace than accuracy and question the necessity of this evolution. Additionally, we highlight one particular network, ShuffleNetV2(2018), that achieved a competitive performance for its time while maintaining a much lower energy consumption. Nevertheless, we highlight that the results are model dependent.","tags":["GreenAI"],"title":"Batching for Green AI - An Exploratory Study on Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wander Siemers","June Sallou","Luís Cruz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692865882,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692865882,"objectID":"8ace7f92593d3b93fb5071a5841bb95d","permalink":"https://jnsll.github.io/publication/mobileaislr/","publishdate":"2023-08-24T10:31:22+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mobileaislr/","section":"publication","summary":"Artificial intelligence is bringing ever new functionalities to the realm of mobile devices that are now considered essential (e.g., camera and voice assistants, recommender systems). Yet, operating artificial intelligence takes up a substantial amount of energy. However, artificial intelligence is also being used to enable more energy-efficient solutions for mobile systems. Hence, artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these devices, playing a part in both the solution and the problem. In this paper, we present a review of the literature of the past decade on the usage of artificial intelligence within the realm of green mobile computing. From the analysis of 34 papers, we highlight the emerging patterns and map the field into 13 main topics that are summarized in details. Our results showcase that the field is slowly increasing in the past years, more specifically, since 2019. Regarding the double impact AI has on the mobile energy consumption, the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems is under-studied in comparison to the usage of AI for energy-efficient mobile computing, and we argue for more exploratory studies in that direction. We observe that although most studies are framed as solution papers (94%), the large majority do not make those solutions publicly available to the community. Moreover, we also show that most contributions are purely academic (28 out of 34 papers) and that we need to promote the involvement of the mobile software industry in this field.","tags":[],"title":"The Two Faces of AI in Green Mobile Computing: A Literature Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686818700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686818700,"objectID":"a06a5be9c36cd23cea70b7c31e2cfe95","permalink":"https://jnsll.github.io/talk/green-ai-thinking-first-before-using-artificial-intelligence/","publishdate":"2023-06-14T15:05:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/green-ai-thinking-first-before-using-artificial-intelligence/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Sustainability","SE","GreenAI"],"title":"Green AI: Thinking first before using Artificial Intelligence","type":"event"},{"authors":["Tim Yarally","Luís Cruz","Daniel Feitosa","June Sallou","Arie van Deursen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1679671040,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679671040,"objectID":"a0f34a123f15425a126c4582c3b1db56","permalink":"https://jnsll.github.io/publication/cain23/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T16:17:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cain23/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern AI practices all strive towards the same goal: better results. In the context of deep learning, the term “results” often refers to the achieved accuracy on a competitive problem set. In this paper, we adopt an idea from the emerging field of Green AI to consider energy consumption as a metric of equal importance to accuracy and to reduce any irrelevant tasks or energy usage. We examine the training stage of the deep learning pipeline from a sustainability perspective, through the study of hyperparameter tuning strategies and the model complexity, two factors vastly impacting the overall pipeline’s energy consumption. First, we investigate the effectiveness of grid search, random search and Bayesian optimisation during hyperparameter tuning, and we find that Bayesian optimisation significantly dominates the other strategies. Furthermore, we analyse the architecture of convolutional neural networks with the energy consumption of three prominent layer types: convolutional, linear and ReLU layers. The results show that convolutional layers are the most computationally expensive by a strong margin. Additionally, we observe diminishing returns in accuracy for more energy-hungry models. The overall energy consumption of training can be halved by reducing the network complexity. In conclusion, we highlight innovative and promising energy-efficient practices for training deep learning models. To expand the application of Green AI, we advocate for a shift in the design of deep learning models, by considering the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Uncovering Energy-Efficient Practices in Deep Learning Training: Preliminary Steps Towards Green AI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena Poenaru-Olaru","June Sallou","Luís Cruz","Jan Rellermeyer","Arie van Deursen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1679411840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679411840,"objectID":"99aaca81549f35f0e094090b14d03b66","permalink":"https://jnsll.github.io/publication/greens23/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T16:17:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/greens23/","section":"publication","summary":"Deployed machine learning systems often suffer from accuracy degradation over time generated by constant data shifts, also known as concept drift.

AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.

To address this issue, in recent years, studies have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data- centric approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset modifications (number of data points and number of features). Our results show evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results, we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved. In conclusion, this exploratory investigation empirically demonstrates the importance of applying data-centric techniques to improve AI energy efficiency. Our results call for a research agenda that focuses on data-centric techniques, to further enable and democratize Green AI.","tags":[],"title":"Data-Centric Green AI: An Exploratory Empirical Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benoit Combemale","Jorg Kienzle","Gunter Mussbacher","Hyacinth Ali","Daniel Amyot","Mojtaba Bagherzadeh","Edouard Batot","Nelly Bencomo","Benjamin Benni","Jean-Michel Bruel","Jordi Cabot","Betty H.C.

Existing approaches involve the application of either time-consuming model reduction techniques or resource-demanding statistical approaches. Such requirements prevent any opportunistic model exploration, e.g., exploring various scenarios on environmental models. This limits the ability to analyse new models for scientists, to support trade-off analysis for decision-makers and to empower the general public towards informed environmental intelligence. In this paper, we present a new approximate computing technique, aka. loop aggregation, which consists in automatically reducing the main loop of a simulation model by aggregating the corresponding spatial or temporal data. We apply this approximate scientific computing approach on a geophysical model of a hydraulic simulation with various input data. The experimentation demonstrates the ability to drastically decrease the simulation time while preserving acceptable results with a minimal set-up. We obtain a median speed-up of 95.13% and up to 99.78% across all the 23 case studies.","tags":[],"title":"Loop Aggregation for Approximate Scientific Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
