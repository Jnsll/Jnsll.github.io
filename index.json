To address this issue, in recent years, studies have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data- centric approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset modifications (number of data points and number of features). Our results show evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results, we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved. In conclusion, this exploratory investigation empirically demonstrates the importance of applying data-centric techniques to improve AI energy efficiency. Our results call for a research agenda that focuses on data-centric techniques, to further enable and democratize Green AI.","tags":[],"title":"Data-Centric Green AI: An Exploratory Empirical Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benoit Combemale","Jorg Kienzle","Gunter Mussbacher","Hyacinth Ali","Daniel Amyot","Mojtaba Bagherzadeh","Edouard Batot","Nelly Bencomo","Benjamin Benni","Jean-Michel Bruel","Jordi Cabot","Betty H.C.

Computer languages have an impact on both activities and related concerns, as well as on the engineering principles required to ensure the development of reliable scientific software.

In this paper, we investigate the different levels of abstraction, linked to the diverse artifacts of the scientific software development process, a software language can propose, and the V\u0026V facilities associated to the corresponding level of abstraction the language can provide to the user. We aim to raise awareness among scientists, engineers and language providers on their shared responsibility in developing reliable scientific software.","tags":[],"title":"When Scientific Software Meets Software Engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["June Sallou","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Existing approaches involve the application of either time-consuming model reduction techniques or resource-demanding statistical approaches. Such requirements prevent any opportunistic model exploration, e.g., exploring various scenarios on environmental models. This limits the ability to analyse new models for scientists, to support trade-off analysis for decision-makers and to empower the general public towards informed environmental intelligence. In this paper, we present a new approximate computing technique, aka. loop aggregation, which consists in automatically reducing the main loop of a simulation model by aggregating the corresponding spatial or temporal data. We apply this approximate scientific computing approach on a geophysical model of a hydraulic simulation with various input data. The experimentation demonstrates the ability to drastically decrease the simulation time while preserving acceptable results with a minimal set-up. We obtain a median speed-up of 95.13% and up¬†to 99.78% across all the 23 case studies.","tags":[],"title":"Loop Aggregation for Approximate Scientific Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
