      <description>Doctorate I&amp;rsquo;m currently a PhD Student in Software Engineering and Hydrogeology at the University of Rennes 1. My doctorate is part of a collaboration between the IRISA and OSUR laboratories and reflects the desire to bring software engineering closer to the scientific field of hydrogeology. Thus, I participate in the research activities of the DiverSE and DIMENV@risce teams.
My research work mainly focuses on modelling for decision making and flood risk assessment.</description>
